# Quick Text Editor

  Quick Text Editor is a fast and simple text editor, modelled after
  IBM's OS/2 System Editor and Aaron Lawrence's AE.  It is written
  using Qt4 and is intended to be cross-platform, although at present
  official builds are only provided for OS/2.

  The philosophy behind QE is to provide a simple tool for quickly
  reading and/or editing text files.  It is not a programmer's editor,
  word processor, or document manager.  As such, it doesn't provide 
  developer features like syntax highlighting, code completion, folding,
  compiler integration, or anything else that could get in the user's
  way, clutter up the interface, or cause lengthy load times.

  What it does aim to provide is the essentials for viewing and editing
  plain text.  This includes straightforward yet flexible search and 
  replace, a go-to-line feature, basic printing support, the ability to
  read text files in different encodings, and full support for displaying
  Unicode text.
