# Quick Text Editor

  Quick Text Editor is a simple text editor modelled after IBM's OS/2
  System Editor and Aaron Lawrence's AE.  It is written using Qt4 and
  is therefore reasonably cross-platform.

  The philosophy behind QE is to provide a simple tool for quickly
  reading and/or editing text files.  It is not a programmer's editor,
  word processor, or document manager.  As such, it doesn't provide
  developer features like syntax highlighting, code completion, folding,
  compiler integration, or anything else that could get in the user's
  way, clutter up the interface, or cause lengthy load times.

  What it does aim to provide is the essentials for viewing and editing
  plain text.  This includes straightforward yet flexible search and
  replace, a go-to-line feature, basic printing support, the ability to
  read text files in different encodings, and full support for displaying
  Unicode text.
